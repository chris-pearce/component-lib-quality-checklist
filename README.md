# Component Quality Checklist

[ ] My component does not create any horizontal or vertical whitespace outside of itself.
    
    ## Huh?
    
    If you have two instances of the same component or two completely different components as the children of a parent element, for example:
    
    ```html
    <div>
      <div>
      <div>
    </div>
    ```
